Skeleton: A **complete framework** for building **Node.js** web applications.

**Live Demo**: [Skeleton](http://skeleton-app.jit.su)

There are many excellent Node/Express/Mongo frameworks out there. I have played with many, and contributed to a few of them. Since there is really no one "right" way to do things you kind of have to explore.  Once I did that I found that none of them were "just right" as Goldilocks would say. So I built this one! 

I borrowed heavily from [Hackathon-starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) and [Drywall](https://github.com/jedireza/drywall). The reason is third party OAUTH authentication is painful. [Passportjs](http://passportjs.org/) helps tremendously but there are not many good examples of how to use it. Both of these frameworks really show how it's done. Both are actively maintained and are really great starting points. I recommend either of them **highly**. 

Of the two, Drywall is more sophisticated. It has an extensive User/Account/Roles system to handle different types of accounts and account permissions.  It also has a very cool Administration area. In addition, the client side uses Backbone.  This framework allows for unique scripts and css on a per page basis - nice! Overall this framework has some GREAT stuff in it.  It's just maybe a little too big/rich if you just want to start building a simple site.

This brings us to Hackathon-starter. This is GREAT site to get started with and has many outstanding API integrations as well as the authentication all built out. It really lives up to it's billing.  It was easier to build up from here rather than take stuff out of Drywall.

#### Other Frameworks to check out

- [Dozer](http://dozerjs.com/)
- [Locomotive](http://locomotivejs.org/)
- [Flatiron](http://flatironjs.org/)
- API Only: [Restify](http://mcavage.me/node-restify/)

So why offer "yet another framework"?  First, I like a fully working built-out site as a starting point to "see" a framework in action. Also because I want a playground of my own **and** you might find something interesting in here!

Like what we do?

  + Express.js
  + Gulp.js build system
  + Jade templates (all nicely laid out: head, navigation, footer, etc.)
  + LESS stylesheets 
  + Bootstrap 3 UI
  + FontAwesome
- **MVC project structure** (in my own style - "Views" are the Jade Templates, "Models" are the Mongo/Mongoose models, and "Controllers" are the glue for routing, page logic and data access via the models. These should be the only things you need to touch to build out new pages/functionality.)
- **Robust Authentication**

- **Sample Pages**
  + Contact Form
  + Boilerplate Terms and Privacy pages. Note: **I am not a lawyer**. These have never been reviewed or even **seen** by a lawyer as far as you know. Use them only as a starting point with **your lawyer.**

Oh, and it's pretty optimized due to the Gulp build pipeline.  This is running on one drone at Nodejitsu ($9/mo!):

Prerequisites
-------------

- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) - however I recommend [Mongolab](http://monglolab.com), more below about this.
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
- Command Line Tools (some NPM modules must be compiled):
 - **Mac OS X**: [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (or **OS X 10.9 Mavericks**: `xcode-select --install`)
 - **Windows**: [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-express-windows-8)
 - **Ubuntu**: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`
 - **Fedora**: `sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"`
 - **OpenSUSE**: `sudo zypper install --type pattern devel_basis`

:exclamation: **Note**: If you are new to Node.js or Express framework,
I highly recommend watching [Node.js and Express 101](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0JlMZCtNU) screencast by Alex Ford that teaches Node and Express from scratch. Alternatively, here is another great tutorial for complete beginners - [Getting Started With Node.js, Express, MongoDB](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/).

Getting Started
---------------

```bash
# Install global dependencies
npm install -g nodemon gulp

# Fetch only the latest commits.
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:dstroot/skeleton.git
cd skeleton

# Install local dependencies
npm install
bower install

# Start everything up with Gulp 
# (builds the assets and starts the app with nodemon)
gulp
```

>:exclamation: But it probably won't really run yet! Go setup `config/config.js`. To use any of the APIs or OAuth authentication methods, you will need to obtain appropriate credentials: Client ID, Client Secret, API Key, or Username & Password. You will need to go through each provider to generate new credentials. See below:

Gulp Build System
-----------------

<a href="http://gulpjs.com">
  <img width="50" src="https://raw.github.com/gulpjs/artwork/master/gulp.png"/>
</a>

Many people use Express.js middleware to build assets, however I generally like a seperate build system like Grunt or Gulp.

Our build system compiles and minifies all assets and starts the app app using nodemon.  Nodemon will restart node every time a server .js file changes.  We also start a livereload server that will trigger a reload of your page in the browser when any client .js, .css, .jade or images change.

To take advantage of the livereload functionality install Google Chrome and then using the chrome web store install the [livereload chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei). :exclamation: Click on the tiny center dot to turn on the livereload capability after you start up via `gulp`.

Now every time you make a change to a client component things will be recompiled and your browser will reload. Cool!

Coding Style
------------

A few notes on my coding style: 

- I like braces and use them always, even for single-line if statements and the like. 
- I like variable names that mean something, rather than trying to be short. 
- I favor single quotes above double quotes. 
- I use a LOT of comments, because JS can always be minified so there's really no reason to worry about comments contributing to filesize. My assumption is I will have to go change something 12 months from now and want to quickly see what is going on. 
- I use a decent amount of whitespace for the same reason. 
- I like my opening braces on the same line, not a new line.
- My eyes like alignment so I can scan down lists of things quickly (like dependencies).

This and more is pre-configured in the `.jshintrc` file.

Pro Tips
--------
- When you install a new npm package, add a *--save* flag and it will be automatially
added to `package.json` as well. For example, `npm install --save moment`.
- Use [async.parallel()](https://github.com/caolan/async#parallel) when you neeed to run multiple
asynchronous tasks, and then render a page, but only when all tasks are completed. For example, you might
want to scrape 3 different websites for some data (async operation) and render the results
on a page after all 3 websites have been scraped.
- Need to find a specific object inside an Array? Use [_.findWhere](http://underscorejs.org/#findWhere) function from Underscore.js. For example, this is how you would retrieve a Twitter token from database: `var token = _.findWhere(req.user.tokens, { kind: 'twitter' });`, where `req.user.tokens` is an Array, and a second parameter is an object with a given key/value.
- If you right click and select **View Page Source**, notice how *Express*
minified HTML for you. If you would like to see non-minified markup,
add `app.locals.pretty = true;` to **app.js** with the rest of the Express configuration.

FAQ
---

### Why do I keep getting `403 Error: Forbidden` on submitting a **POST** request?

You may need to add this hidden input element to your form.
```
input(type='hidden', name='_csrf', value=token)
```

### What is app_cluster.js?

From the [Node.js Documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html#cluster_how_it_works):
> A single instance of Node runs in a single thread. To take advantage of multi-core systems
> the user will sometimes want to launch a cluster of Node processes to handle the load.
> The cluster module allows you to easily create child processes that all share server ports.

`app_cluster.js` allows you to take advantage of this feature by forking a process of `app.js`
for each CPU detected. For the majority of applications serving HTTP requests,
this is a resounding boon. However, the cluster module is still in experimental stage, therefore it should only be used after understanding its purpose and behavior. To use it, simply run `node app_cluster.js`. **Its use is entirely optional and `app.js` is not tied in any way to it**. As a reminder, if you plan to use `app_cluster.js` instead of `app.js`, be sure to indicate that in `Procfile` if you are deploying your app to Heroku.

### I am getting MongoDB Connection Error, how do I fix it?

As the message says, you need to have a MongoDB server running before launching `app.js` and a valid URL connection string in `config/config.js`.

You can get MongoDB from [mongodb.org/downloads](mongodb.org/downloads), or install it via a package manager ([Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on Mac, **apt-get** on Ubuntu, **yum** on Fedora, etc.).

**Even Better:** Setup a free account with [Mongolab](https://mongolab.com/welcome/) and get a free database to develop with.  More below.  

### I get an error when I deploy my app, why?

Chances are you haven't changed the *Dabatase URI* in `secrets.js`. If `db` is set to `localhost`, it will only work on your machine as long as MongoDB is running. When you deploy to Heroku, OpenShift or some other provider, you will not have MongoDB running on `localhost`. 

You need to create an account with [MongoLab](http://mongolab.com) or [MongoHQ](http://mongohq.com), then create a free tier database. See **Deployment** section for more information on how to setup an account and a new database step-by-step with MongoLab.

### Why Jade instead of Handlebars template engine?

Subjectively speaking, Jade looks much cleaner and shorter than Handlebars, or any non-HAML style for that matter.  I like it.

### Why do you have all routes defined in app.js?

For the sake of simplicity. While there might be a better approach,
such as passing `app` context to each controller as outlined in this
[blog](http://timstermatic.github.io/blog/2013/08/17/a-simple-mvc-framework-with-node-and-express/),
I find such style to be confusing for beginners.
It took me a long time to grasp the concept of `exports` and `module.exports`,
let alone having a global `app` reference in other files.
That to me is a backward thinking.
The `app.js` is the "heart of the app", it should be the one referencing
models, routes, controllers, etc.
When working solo on small projects I actually prefer to have everything inside `app.js` as is the case with [this]((https://github.com/sahat/ember-sass-express-starter/blob/master/app.js))
REST API server.

### Can I use Ember, Angular or Backbone with Skeleton?

Absolutely!  But things get messy quickly.  In Drywall, several of the pages are Backbone apps.  You can check that out. 

In here we have a redimentary AJAX page (the accounts page for administrators) - that could be a good starting point.

###:bulb: How do flash messages work in this project?

Flash messages allow you to display a message at the end of the request and access it on next request and only next request. For instance, on a failed login attempt, you would display an alert with some error message, but as soon as you refresh that page or visit a different page and come back to the login page, that error message will be gone. It is only displayed once.

This project uses *express-flash* module for flash messages. And that module is built on top of *connect-flash*, which is what I used in this project initially. With *express-flash* you don't have to explicity send a flash message to every view inside `res.render()`. All flash messages are available in your views via `messages` object by default, thanks to *express-flash*.

Flash messages have a two-step process. You use `req.flash('errors', { msg: 'Error messages goes here' }`
to create a flash message in your controllers, and then display them in your views:

```jade
if messages.errors
  .alert.alert-danger.animated.fadeIn
    for error in messages.errors
      div= error.msg
```

In the first step, `'errors'` is the name of a flash message, which should match the name of the property on `messages` object in your views. You place alert messages inside `if message.errors` because you don't want to show them flash messages are actually present.

The reason why you pass an error like `{ msg: 'Error messages goes here' }` instead of just a string - `'Error messages goes here'`, is for the sake of consistency. To clarify that, *express-validator* module which is used for validating and sanitizing user's input, returns all errors as an array of objects, where each object has a `msg` property with a message why an error has occured. Here is a more general example of what express-validator returns when there are errors present:

```js
[
  { param: "name", msg: "Name is required", value: "<received input>" },
  { param: "email", msg: "A valid email is required", value: "<received input>" }
]
```

To keep consistent with that style, you should pass all flash messages
as `{ msg: 'My flash message' }` instead of a string. Otherwise you will just see an alert box without an error message. That is because, in **partials/flash.jade** template it will try to output `error.msg` (i.e. `"My flash message".msg`), in other words it will try to call a `msg` method on a *String* object,
which will return *undefined*. Everything I just mentioned about errors, also applies to "info" and "success" flash messages, and you could even create a new one yourself, such as:

**Data Usage Controller (Example)**

```
req.flash('warning', 'You have exceeded 90% of your data usage');
```

**User Account Page (Example)**

```jade
if messages.warning
  .alert.alert-warning.animated.fadeIn
    for warning in messages.warning
      div= warning.msg
```

`partials/flash.jade` is a partial template that contains how flash messages
are formatted. If you don't like the *fadeIn* animation, try something like
*flipInX* (refer to [animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)), or just delete `.animated.fadeIn` from alerts if you don't want any animations. Or if you want to customize your flash messages by displaying ✔ on success flash and ✗ on error flash, this is the place where you would do all those customizations. Previously, flash messages were scattered throughout each view that used flash messages (contact, login, signup, profile), but now, thankfully it is uses a *DRY* approach.

The flash messages partial template is *included* in the `layout.jade`, along with footer and navigation.

```jade
body
  #wrap
    include partials/navigation
    .container
      include partials/flash
      block content
  include partials/footer
```

If you have any further questions about flash messages,
please feel free to open an issue and I will update this mini-guide accordingly, or send a pull request if you  would like to include something that I missed.

###:snowman: How do I create a new page?

A more correct way to be to say "How do I create a route". The main file `app.js` contains all the routes. Each route has a callback function (aka controller) associated with it. Sometimes you will see 3 or more arguments
to routes. In cases like that, the first argument is still a URL string, the middle arguments are what's called middleware. Think of middleware as a door. If this door prevents you from continuing forward, well, you won't get to your callback function (aka controller). One such example is authentication.

```js
app.get('/account', passportConf.isAuthenticated, userController.getAccount);
```

It always goes from left to right. A user visits `/account` page. Then `isAuthenticated` middleware checks if you are authenticated:

```js
exports.isAuthenticated = function(req, res, next) {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) return next();
  res.redirect('/login');
};
```

If you are authenticated, you let this visitor pass through your "door" by calling `return next();`. It then proceeds to the next middleware until it reaches the last argument which is a callback function that usually renders a template, or responds with a JSON data, if you are building a REST API. But in this example it simply renders a page and nothing more:

```js
exports.getAccount = function(req, res) {
  res.render('account/profile', {
    title: 'Account Management'
  });
};
```

Express.js has `app.get`, `app.post`, `app.put`, `app.del`, but for the most part you will only use the first two. If you just want to display a page, then use `GET`, if you are submitting a form, sending a file then use `POST`.

Here is a typical workflow of adding new routes to your application. Let's say we are building a page that lists all books from database.

**Step 1.** Start by defining a route.

```js
app.get('/books', bookController.getBooks);

```

**Step 2.** Create a new controller file called `book.js`.

```js
/**
 * GET /books
 * List all books.
 */

exports.getBooks = function(req, res) {
  Book.find(function(err, docs) {
    res.render('books', { books: docs });
  });
};
```

**Step 3.** Import that controller in `app.js`.

```js
var bookController = require('./controllers/book');
```

**Step 4.** Create `books.jade` template.

```jade
extends layout

block content
  .page-header
    h3 All Books

  ul
    for book in books
      li= book.name
```

That's it! I will say that you could have combined Step 1, 2, 3 as following:

```js
app.get('/books', function(req, res) {
  Book.find(function(err, docs) {
    res.render('books', { books: docs });
  });
});
```

Sure, it's simpler, but as soon as you pass 1000 lines of code in `app.js` it becomes a little difficult to navigate the file. I mean, the whole point of this boilerplate project was to separate concerns, so you could work with your teammates without running into *MERGE CONFLICTS*. Imagine you have 4 developers
working on a single `app.js`, I promise you it won't be fun resolving merge conflicts all the time.If you are the only developer then it's fine. But as I said, once it gets up to a certain LoC size, it becomes difficult to maintain everything in a single file.

That's all there is to it. Express.js is super simple to use.
Most of the time you will be dealing with other APIs to do the real work:
[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) for querying database, socket.io for sending and receiving messages over websockets, sending emails via [Nodemailer](http://www.nodemailer.com/), form validation using [express-validator](https://github.com/ctavan/express-validator) library,
parsing websites using [Cheerio](https://github.com/MatthewMueller/cheerio), and etc.

###:dizzy: How do I use Socket.io with Hackathon Starter?

Heroku supports websockets, but not until you opt-in by running this command:

```js
heroku labs:enable websockets -a myapp
```

And what if you are deploying to OpenShift? They do support websockets, but it is currently in a preview state. So, for OpenShift you would need to change the socket.io connect URI to the following:

```js
var socket = io.connect('http://yoursite-namespace.rhcloud.com:8000');
```

Wait, why is it on port 8000? Who knows, and if I didn't run across this [blog post](http://velin-georgiev-blog.appspot.com/blog/set-up-nodejs-express-socketio-application-using-websockets-on-openshift-by-red-hat/)
I wouldn't even know I had to use port 8000.

I am really glad that Heroku and OpenShift at least
have a websockets support, because many other PaaS providers still do not support it.
Due to the aforementioned issues with websockets, I cannot include socket.io as part of the Hackathon Starter. *For now...*
If you need to use socket.io in your app, please continue reading.

First you need to install socket.io:
```js
npm install socket.io --save
```

Replace `var app = express();` with the following code:

```js
var app = express();
var http = require('http');
var server = http.createServer(app);
var io = require('socket.io').listen(server);
```

I like to have the following code organization in `app.js` (from top to bottom): module dependencies,
import controllers, import configs, connect to database, express configuration, routes,
start the server, socket.io stuff. That way I always know where to look for things.

Add the following code at the end of `app.js`:

```js
io.configure(function() {
  io.set('transports', ['websocket']);
});

io.sockets.on('connection', function(socket) {
  socket.emit('greet', { hello: 'Hey, Mr.Client!' });
  socket.on('respond', function(data) {
    console.log(data);
  });
  socket.on('disconnect', function() {
    console.log('Socket disconnected');
  });
});
```

We are done with the server-side business.

You now have a choice - to include your JavaScript code in Jade templates or have all your client-side
JavaScript in a separate file - in `main.js`. I will admit, when I first started out with Node.js and JavaScript in general,
I placed all JavaScript code inside templates because I have access to template variables passed in from Express
right then and there. It's the easiest thing you can do, but also the least efficient and harder to maintain. Since then I
almost never include inline JavaScript inside templates anymore.

But it's also understandable if you want take the easier road.
Most of the time you don't even care about performance during hackathons, you just
want to [*"get shit done"*](http://www.startupvitamins.com/media/products/13/aaron_levie_poster_black.jpg) before the time runs out.
Well, either way, use whichever approach makes more sense to you. At the end of the day,
it's **what** you build that matters, not **how** you build it.

If you want to stick all your JavaScript inside templates, then in `layout.jade` -
your main template file, add this to `head` block.

```jade
script(src='/socket.io/socket.io.js?v=#{cacheBuster}')
script.
    var socket = io.connect(window.location.href);
    socket.on('greet', function (data) {
      console.log(data);
      socket.emit('respond', { message: 'Hello to you too, Mr.Server!' });
    });
```

**Note**: Notice the path of the `socket.io.js`, you don't actually
have to have `socket.io.js` file anywhere in your project; it will be generated automatically
at runtime.

If you want to have JavaScript code separate from templates, move that inline script code into `main.js`,
inside the `$(document).ready()` function:

```js
$(document).ready(function() {

  // Place JavaScript code here...
  var socket = io.connect(window.location.href);
  socket.on('greet', function (data) {
    console.log(data);
    socket.emit('respond', { message: 'Hello to you too, Mr.Server!' });
  });

});
```

And that's it, we are done!

Deployment
----------

Once you are ready to deploy your app, you will need to create an account with a cloud platform to host it. These are not
the only choices, but they are my top picks. Create an account with **MongoLab** and then pick one of the 4 providers
below. Once again, there are plenty of other choices and you are not limited to just the ones listed below. From my
experience, **Heroku** is the easiest to get started with, it will automatically restart your node.js process when it crashes, custom domain support on free accounts, hot push deployments, and *Hackathon Starter* already includes `Procfile`, which is necessary for deployment to **Heroku**.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/7KnCa5a.png" width="200">
- Open [mongolab.com](https://mongolab.com) website
- Click the yellow **Sign up** button
- Fill in your user information then hit **Create account**
- From the dashboard, click on **:zap:Create new** button
- Select **any** cloud provider (I usually go with AWS)
- Under *Plan* click on **Single-node (development)** tab and select **Sandbox** (it's free)
 - *Leave MongoDB version as is - `2.4.x`*
- Enter *Database name** for your web app
- Then click on **:zap:Create new MongoDB deployment** button
- Now, to access your database you need to create a DB user
- You should see the following message:
 - *A database user is required to connect to this database.* **Click here** *to create a new one.*
- Click the link and fill in **DB Username** and **DB Password** fields
- Finally, in `secrets.js` instead of `db: 'localhost'`, use the following URI with your credentials:
 - `db: 'mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds027479.mongolab.com:27479/<dbname>'`

> **:exclamation:Note**: As an alternative to MongoLab, there is also [MongoHQ](http://www.mongohq.com/home).

<img src="http://blog.exadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/heroku-Logo-1.jpg" width="200">
- Download and install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/osx)
- In terminal, run `heroku login` and enter your Heroku credentials
- From *your app* directory run `heroku create`, followed by `git push heroku master`
- Done!

<img src="http://www.opencloudconf.com/images/openshift_logo.png" width="200">
- First, install this Ruby gem: `sudo gem install rhc` :gem:
- Run `rhc login` and enter your OpenShift credentials
- From *your app* directory run `rhc app create MyApp nodejs-0.10`
 - **Note**: *MyApp* is what you want to name your app (no spaces)
- Once that is done, you will be provided with **URL**, **SSH** and **Git Remote** links
- Visit that **URL** and you should see *Welcome to your Node.js application on OpenShift* page
- Copy **Git Remote** and paste it into `git remote add openshift your_git_remote`
- Before you push your app, you need to do a few modifications to your code

Add these two lines to `app.js`, just place them anywhere before `app.listen()`:
```js
var IP_ADDRESS = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP || '127.0.0.1';
var PORT = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_PORT || 8080;
```

Then change `app.listen()` to:
```js
app.listen(PORT, IP_ADDRESS, function() {
  console.log("✔ Express server listening on port %d in %s mode", PORT, app.settings.env);
});
```
Add this to `package.json`, after *name* and *version*. This is necessary because, by default, OpenShift looks for `server.js` file. And by specifying `supervisor app.js` it will automatically restart the server when node.js process crashes.

```js
"main": "app.js",
"scripts": {
  "start": "supervisor app.js"
},
```

- Finally, now you can push your code to OpenShift by running `git push -f openshift master`
 - **Note**: The first time you run this command, you have to pass `-f` (force) flag because OpenShift creates a dummy server with the welcome page when you create a new Node.js app. Passing `-f` flag will override everything with your *Hackathon Starter* project repository. Please **do not** do `git pull` as it will create unnecessary merge conflicts.
- And you are done! (Not quite as simple as Heroku, huh?)
